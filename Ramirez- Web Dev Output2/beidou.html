      <h1>Beidou</h1>
      <p>
        Beidou, the captain of the Crux Fleet, is admired across Liyue for her 
        strength, courage, and free-spirited leadership. Known as the “Uncrowned Lord 
        of the Ocean,” she commands respect from both her crew and her rivals on the sea. 
        Her hearty laugh and fearless nature make her a true legend.
