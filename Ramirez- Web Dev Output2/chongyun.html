      <h1>Chongyun</h1>
      <p>
        Chongyun is an exorcist from Liyue blessed — or cursed — with excessive yang energy.  
          His pure, positive aura makes it impossible for spirits to approach him,  
          often leaving his exorcisms surprisingly straightforward.  
          Despite his cool exterior, Chongyun is a kind-hearted and earnest young man.
